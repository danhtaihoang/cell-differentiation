Population Balancing with Species Switching
=============================================================================================

Abstract
-----------------------------
Biological organisms are composed of cells differentiated from stem cells. Emerging evidence
suggests phenotypic switches of differentiated cells, called transdifferentiation, during development
and under pathophysiological conditions. To examine the role of transdifferentiation for population
balances, we construct a stochastic model mapped into urn problems. When a colored ball is
drawn from an urn, one additional ball with the same color is put into the urn in Polya’s urn
scheme while the drawn ball is replaced by another ball with different color in Ehrenfest’s urn
scheme. Our population balance model is a mixture of the two classic urn problems corresponding
to cell replication and transdifferentiation. Because a dominant population is more likely to be
drawn, the preferential replication and transdifferentiation of the dominant population contribute
to increasing and decreasing the gap between the two populations, respectively. Therefore, their
competition determines population balancing. We analyze the dependence of population dynamics
on the replication and the transdifferentiation rates of each population. Finally, experimentally
probing the event of transdifferentiation is a challenging problem because it is indistinguishable
from death of one cell type and concurrent replication of another cell type. Our analysis suggests
that transdifferentiation generates fewer fluctuations in population dynamics than the combined
events of cell death and replication do.
